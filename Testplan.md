#Name- what it will do - Who will use it !!1
Nomada is the name of the app -It will:Track, protect, and support safe migration paths for wildlife.
This people will use it -Researchers, nature lovers, and everyday people working together to protect animal migration routes and keep wildlife moving safely.
What does it do ?The app maps animal migration routes, tracks threats, and connects communities to protect wildlife movement.

#About the app:This year, I read an article that really stayed with me. It talked about how over a million birds died during their migration — not because of predators, but because they were exhausted and couldn’t find safe places to rest. Storms, city lights, and new construction sites disrupted their natural paths.
What shocked me most was learning how deeply that loss affects not just the birds, but also the forests they help grow and even the people who live near them. Birds spread seeds, balance ecosystems, and connect continents.
That’s when I thought: what if we had a way to track migration, spot dangers, and help protect those paths? So I came up with the idea for this app — to map, monitor, and protect migratory routes, while involving communities, researchers, and nature lovers who want to help.
It’s a small step to protect nature’s travelers — and to protect all of us in the process.
#I hope to: Protect wildlife migration routes and reduce animal deaths by making it easier for people to see, understand, and act on the threats they face
#By testing this app:I want to test the app to catch bugs, make sure maps and alerts work correctly, and that users can easily report sightings or dangers without confusion.Also the the maptracking is working perfectly.
#The parts of the app that I will like to test are: Live map showing migration routes for different species , Tabs for animal type (birds, mammals, sea life)Filter by region or species meaning the map road that has been recorded.
I also want to test the Danger alerts such as--- Warns about construction, wildfires, roads, or other disruptions in migration paths and Data from local governments, satellite feeds, or user reports.Login or User Profile (if needed)
Test if users can sign up or log in without problems,Check if their saved sightings or favorites stay saved
#Testing everything from the Get Go- I will like to test all the aspects of the app from the beggining or as much as I can at least.
#Testing- How? When ? Who will test and what we will need ? We will test the app step by step as it’s being built, and again after each new feature is added. This helps us find bugs early and make sure everything works. As testers, we’ll focus on things like: does the map load? Can users report animal sightings easily? Do alerts show up in the right place? We’ll test on phones and computers using a demo version of the app. To do this, we’ll need basic tools like the app itself, an internet connection, some fake data to test with, and a simple checklist to track what works and what doesn’t.
#How much time do we need how kong will it take -- and what will achieve at the end of the testing? We plan to start testing as soon as the first version of the app is ready, and continue testing each time we add a new feature. Each test session might take about 1 to 2 hours, depending on what we’re checking. We’ll test a few times a week to make sure everything works and is easy to use. By the end of testing, we hope to have a working app with fewer bugs, clear features, and feedback that shows it’s ready for people to use and help protect wildlife.
#Who is dong what? I am the main tester, i work with coders for them to fix what the bugs are showing and also i have a few vounteers that are animal activist and work with nature to help mock some of the app features.. and give me feed back.
#What could go wrong during testing and how I'd fix it? Many things can go wrong with the app- from loadng up the correct locations fo the migrating routes to how users sign up and record their information- How I'd fix it wil be to me a check list of the bugs we see poping out every time we run the app and tackel those right away- this is why it is impportant to test progressively and often , to gather enough Data that it would serve the purpose for me to developed a daily routine of servicing and eliminating errors.
